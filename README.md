# Cellular Automaton for Environmental Simulation

## Overview

The Cellular Automaton for Environmental Simulation project aims to model a dynamic world containing various elements such as land, sea, clouds, glaciers, forests, 
cities, wind, and air pollution. This cellular automaton simulates the interactions between these elements over time, taking into account factors such as wind direction,
intensity, temperature changes, and human activities.

## Elements of the World

1. **Land, Sea, Clouds, Glaciers, Forests, and Cities:** Different terrain types and human settlements exist in the world, each with distinct characteristics and heights.
2. **Variability:** The world's features vary from place to place and evolve over time.
3. **Wind:** The wind blows with varying intensity and direction across the world, influencing the movement of clouds and air pollution.
4. **Clouds and Rain:** Clouds carried by the wind may release precipitation in the form of rain.
5. **Air Pollution:** Pollution, primarily emitted from cities, spreads through the atmosphere and affects air quality.

## Interactions and Dynamics

- **Temperature Changes:** Air pollution contributes to warming the atmosphere, leading to temperature changes.
- **Wind Dispersal:** The wind disperses pollutants and influences the movement of clouds.
- **Glacier Melting:** Increased temperatures from air pollution and warmer climates cause glaciers to melt.
- **Ecosystem Impact:** Changes in temperature and precipitation affect ecosystems, including forests and marine life.
- **Human Influence:** Human activities, such as urbanization and industrialization, contribute to air pollution and environmental changes.

## Transition Function

The transition from one day to another in the cellular automaton takes into account these interactions:
1. Evaluate the effects of wind on cloud movement and air pollution dispersion.
2. Determine temperature changes based on air pollution levels and natural factors.
3. Calculate the impact of temperature changes on glaciers, ecosystems, and land features.
4. Update the state of the world based on the interactions between elements and the passage of time.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more complex environmental models, including ocean currents and atmospheric circulation patterns.
- Integrate real-world data to calibrate and validate the simulation's accuracy.
- Develop visualization tools to observe and analyze the simulation results in detail.
